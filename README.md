# Egg-Recipe

This project will address one of my favorite recipes, Egg with Fried Rice.

As of today (March, 16th. 2022) the following project is my first 
real one and will have my updates and upgrades to it. Because of this
fact for now it's going to be mainly HTML language with the intention of
using CSS later when I learn it, giving the site some nice style.
